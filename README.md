##TinyController

This is a small Arduino sketch I wrote for controlling my disk drive. The sketch is written for an attiny85 and requires a 1M resistor and a conductor that acts as a capacitive touch sensor. 

###Dependencies

Requires CapacitiveSensor.h from the [Capacitive Sensor Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense).
